# Doc-Patient-Consultation-Database Application
CCINFOM Requirements

A database system is needed to manage Doctor-Patient consultation records as it can efficiently and securely handle large volumes of private and sensitive data. While excel can perform similar tasks, it lacks the scalability, security, and reliability hospitals need. Databases support more complex queries, ensure quick access while maintaining data integrity, and support multi-user environments. They allow multi-user environments which allow staff and doctors to access records simultaneously and not have to worry about data corruption.
